Description: Reef check is a world citizen survey of corals reef. 
             Because of participation of non-scientist, the survey entered into 
             the database are often non-standardized.
             This can undermine the credibility of the method.
             The aim of the project is to homogenize the data in order to produce 
             the same transparent and reproducible results between years on the island of Mayotte.
